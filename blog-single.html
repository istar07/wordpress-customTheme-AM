		            <p>Hello Anthony, This is a mock blog post. I understand all of this may be confusing to you so, in this post, I’m going to attempt to explain this as clearly and as simply as possible.</p>

		            <h2>A Subheading</h2>

		            <p>What your reading is a blog post. To understand what a blog post is, you have to understand what a blog is in the first place. According to Wikipedia:</p>

		            <blockquote>
		            	<p>'A blog (a truncation of the expression "weblog") is a <strong>discussion or informational website</strong> published on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries ("<strong>posts</strong>").'</p>
		            </blockquote>

		            <p>Essentially, a blog is a regularly updated website containing information on any topic you chose to write about. Whether you chose to write about how your day is going or a tutorial is irrelevant. A blog can be about anything you want it to be about. The individual entries on your blog are called “blog post”. That's basically what this thing that your reading is.</p>

		            <h2>Another Subheading</h2>

		            <p>Please understand that this specific blog post that your reading is just an example of what a blog post on your blog could look like. <strong>YOU SHOULD NOT WRITE THIS VERBATIM ON YOUR REAL BLOG ONCE IT’S READY.</strong> Once again, this is simply an example. It’s written in this way because you have previously expressed bewilderment at the Lorem Ipsum dummy text that previously occupied this space.</p>

		            <p>Interestingly, Lorem Ipsum first appeared in a piece of classical Latin literature by Cicero released in 45 BC, named “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” which, translated to English means “The Extremes of Good and Evil”.</p>

		            <p>This means the text you saw in this space previously is over 2000 years old. However, Lorem Ipsum only became the standard dummy text of the printing industry in the 16th century, just over 500 years ago.</p>

		            <h2>Yet Another Subheading</h2>

		            <p>That information is mostly irrelevant, I just wrote it to take up more space on this blog post. Anyway, I hope I was able to clear up any confusion about what this blog can possibly look like. I also hope you like the redesign of the site, as I don’t plan on making any more major revisions. If this is still unclear to you, feel free to give me a call. I’ll do my best to explain it even further.</p>

		            <p>Please proceed to the next post titled "Another Post" to see an example a blog post with something called a “Featured Image”.</p>
